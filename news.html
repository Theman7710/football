    <p>Chelsea in talks to keep Sancho</p>
    <img src="https://notjustok.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250603_113453.jpg">
    <p>Chelsea would like Sancho to stay if they can agree on contract terms which fit in with the wage structure at the club.</p>
    <p>Sancho joined Chelsea on loan from Manchester United last August and Chelsea now have a £25 million obligation to buy.</p>
    <p>They can pay United a £5 million penalty to get out of the obligation to buy.</p>
    <p>Trent Alexander-Arnold</p>

    <p>Los Blancos kick-start their Club World Cup campaign against Saudi Pro League giants Al-Hilal on June 18, and the Spanish side want the right-back available for that match.</p>
    <p>However, Alexander-Arnold's contract with Liverpool expires on June 30, meaning that Los Blancos will need to negotiate the player out of his terms early.</p>
    <p>There is the scope to complete such a move, with FIFA opening a special transfer window between June 1 and June 10 due to the Club World Cup.</p>
